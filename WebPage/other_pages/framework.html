      <h1 class='center'>Choosing Framework</h1>
      <h2 class='center'>A framework is a tool providing libraries and functions which make development
      faster and easier. There are specific rules on frameworks that should be used in production to implement all the features.</h2>
      <h2 class='center'>First of all, we need to choose the language of programming.
      As python is one of the most common and simple programming languages, we searched for
      machine learning frameworks on python. In this project, we have chosen PyTorch for image classification, as it was the most suitable and beginner-friendly for development.</h2>
